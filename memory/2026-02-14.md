# Solana Jupiter Bot - Auto-Improvement Log
## Date: 2026-02-14

## Summary
Successfully implemented advanced auto-improvement system for the Solana trading bot with ML indicators, backtesting, performance tracking, auto-optimization, and genetic algorithms.

## Implementation Complete

### 1. ML Signal Generation Module
- **RSI Indicator**: Calculates Relative Strength Index for overbought/oversold signals
- **EMA Indicators**: Fast (9) and Slow (21) period EMAs for trend detection
- **Momentum**: Measures price momentum over configurable periods
- **Trend**: Calculates trend direction using price comparison
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Adapts SL/TP based on market volatility

### 2. Backtesting Engine
- Uses historical data from `data/*.csv` files (SOL, JUP, WIF, BONK, PYTH)
- Simulates trades based on ML signals
- Calculates performance metrics: win rate, P&L, profit factor

### 3. Performance Tracking
- Tracks metrics per strategy:
  - Total trades, winning/losing trades
  - Win rate percentage
  - Total P&L
  - Profit factor
  - Average win/loss
- Updates from paper trading state in real-time

### 4. Auto-Optimization
- Adjusts parameters based on performance:
  - Reduces risk if win rate < 40%
  - Widens stop losses if profit factor < 1.0
  - Increases take profit if underperforming
- Triggered every 10 cycles

### 5. Genetic Algorithm
- Population: 20 genomes per generation
- 10 generations with mutation and crossover
- Fitness based on win rate (30%), profit factor (40%), trade count (20%)
- Results stored in `genetic_results.db`
- Best genome: SL=8.92%, TP=9.90%, Risk=18.74%

## Test Results
```
BACKTEST MODE
Available symbols: BONK, PYTH, WIF, SOL, JUP
BONK: 1 trades, 100.0% WR, PnL: $23.52
PYTH: 1 trades, 0.0% WR, PnL: $-4.08
WIF: 1 trades, 100.0% WR, PnL: $16.74
SOL: 1 trades, 0.0% WR, PnL: $-3.56
JUP: 1 trades, 100.0% WR, PnL: $13.59

GENETIC OPTIMIZATION
Gen 1/5: Best Score=0.742
Gen 2/5: Best Score=0.798
Gen 5/5: Best Score=0.798
Best Genome: SL=8.92%, TP=9.90%, Risk=18.74%
```

## Files Modified
- `agent_brain_paper.py` - Complete rewrite with all features

## Usage
```bash
# Standard paper trading mode
python3 agent_brain_paper.py

# Fast mode (60s cycles)
python3 agent_brain_paper.py --fast

# Backtest only
python3 agent_brain_paper.py --backtest

# Genetic optimization only
python3 agent_brain_paper.py --genetic
```

## Next Steps
- Run extended paper trading test (100+ cycles)
- Collect more performance data for better optimization
- Validate genetic algorithm results with longer backtests
- Consider mainnet deployment when win rate > 50% consistently
